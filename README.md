This repository serves as my documentation for the Ecommerce Cohort Analysis on Customer Retention - Alteryx Project.

It showcases my competancy to work with Alteryx Designer and demonstrates my proficiency in essential tools like **In/Out Tools (Browse, Input Data, Output Data & Text Input), Preparation Tools (Select, Filter, Formula, Sort & Unique), Join Tools (Join, Find Replace & Union) and Documentation Tools (Comment & Tool Container)**.......to be updated.......

The entire project has been implemented using Alteryx Designer 2024.1 (User) (with AMP Engine enabled). The raw data source and data output files have been uploaded to this repository data folder.

## Project Objective:
Cohort analysis is a method of grouping customers into cohorts or groups who have undergone a common experience within a specific time frame, such as the date they subscribed to, signed up for or purchased your product. Then you can compare how many customers from each Cohort unit remained active users after one month, two months, three months, etc. This can help you understand the retention patterns and differences between the groupings and their possible causes. In cohort analysis, month 0 usually represents the month when the customer joined or made their first purchase. Cohort Analysis is a valuable technique that enables the extraction of actionable insights related to customer churn, product engagement, product value, and other relevant metrics.

This Alteryx project has been designed with an intent of enhancing e-commerce operations. It has three vital stages: Data Cleanup, Cohort Analysis and Insights generation through which I'll unravel the nuances of online shopping and driving strategic decisions to maximize revenue.
