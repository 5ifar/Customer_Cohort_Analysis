This repository serves as my documentation for the Ecommerce Cohort Analysis on Customer Retention - Alteryx Project.

It showcases my competancy to work with Alteryx Designer and demonstrates my proficiency in essential tools like **In/Out Tools (Browse, Input Data, Output Data & Text Input), Preparation Tools (Select, Filter, Formula, Sort & Unique), Join Tools (Join, Find Replace & Union) and Documentation Tools (Comment & Tool Container)**.......to be updated.......

The entire project has been implemented using Alteryx Designer 2024.1 (User) (with AMP Engine enabled). The raw data source and data output files have been uploaded to this repository data folder.
